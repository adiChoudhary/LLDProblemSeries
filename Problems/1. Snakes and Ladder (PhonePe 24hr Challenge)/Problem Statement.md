You have to design & implement a Snakes and Ladders game that supports the following functionality:  
**Mandatory Requirements:**  
You have to take a configuration (can be a yaml/json file) with the following parameters.  
● Number of players: N  
● Board Size: BS (BS x BS)  
● Number of Snakes: S  
● Number of Ladders: L  
● Number of Dies: D  
● Movement Strategy: MS Note: Movement strategy is either SUM (sum of numbers on dies), MAX (max of numbers on dies), MIN (min of number on dies).
You will be given a sample input to populate the board. Post which the game has to be simulated among N players.
Rules:  
● Snake always takes you to the cell where its tail is, and has to be a number less than  
where you are at currently.  
● Ladder takes you UP (strictly).  
● If a player (A) comes to a cell where another player (B) is placed already, the previously  
placed player (B) has to start again from 1.

```
Optional Extensions:
● Using the configuration you have to generate a random valid board & devise proper
rules for placing objects on the board.
● Write unit tests to validate all implemented functionality and their edge cases.
● Addition of special objects:
	○ Crocodile, which takes you exactly 5 steps back.
	○ Mine which holds you for 2 turns.

Expectations:
● Your code should cover all the functionality explained under “Mandatory Requirements”.
● You should implement at least one of “Optional Extensions”, preferably all.
● Implement a driver program which drives all above rules, and gives turns to players in a
round robin fashion to roll dies.
● Proper logging of all events, e.g rolling dies, movement to new cell, encountering
snakes/ladders etc.
● Code has to handle all edge cases
● Code should be modular enough to add further extensions or rules, without much
changes.
● A manual override must exist for the interviewer to verify the edge cases/ to write unit
tests. The program should take the following as input:
	○ Starting location of each player.
	○ The D die values that each player rolled in a turn.
Guidelines:
● The die roll can be implemented using a random function.

Sample Input and Output:

Input format:
● Total Snakes S
● Following S lines contains pair (Snake’s Head and Snake’s Tail)
● Total Ladders L
● Following L lines contains pair (Ladder bottom and Ladder top)
● N no of players
● Following N lines contains names & starting locations of each Player
● An override to manually enter the D die values that each player rolled in each turn.
(Absent in example. Any input format is fine)
